It uses a non-official template made with [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

The presentation runs in the browser and can be easily deployed with GitHub pages (just enable it in the repo settings). To see the rendered version of this template, click the repository website link.

## Edit Content

Official documentation for remark can be found [here](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki)

## Local deployment

Install Python and run:

python3 -m http.server
```

Afterwards open [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000) in your browser.

You can't just open the HTML file in a browser, as it will not be able to load the content.md file.
